It can split FLAC and WAVE files based on a cuesheet. Features I remember:
 - Add a 'REM OFFSET <N>' line to a cuesheet to add <N> to all track numbers
   for file naming and tagging purposes. For multi-disc albums.
 - Cuesheets can be UTF-8 or ISO8859-1.
 - Pathnames are sanitized to alphanumeric characters and spaces only. Accents
   are stripped for everything up to and including Latin Extended-A, and ß,
   [Ðð], [Þþ], [Ææ], [Œœ], are translated to ss, Dh/dh, Th/th, Ae/ae, Oe/oe.
   All other characters stripped.
   - This caused a problem with Sigur Ros' album '( )' on FAT32 since it
     sanitizes to just ' '.  I have no better solution than hard-coding
     that case.
 - FLAC files always encoded with --best.
 - Replaygain information added with multiflac.
